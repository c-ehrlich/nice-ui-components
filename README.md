# Nice UI Components

## What is this?
While going through the book 'Refactoring UI' I wanted to try to replicate some of the concepts the book teaches. Reading about it is one thing, building it yourself is another.

So here is a series of UI components, handwritten in CSS. No UI libraries, except for [Tabler Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabler-icons-react) for icons. All of them are responsive from desktop to 320px (iPhone 5).

## Setup
Install dependencies
```
yarn
```
Run the test server
```
yarn start
```
View the site (by default it will be at http://localhost:3000)
